We made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided that it would move with two underlined do dats. Like a shelf. 
We know the ramp will have to be fastned to the doodads or it will slide off. 
No matter the solution to the slide-off problem, we need to create doodads that move up and down along with the player input. 
The first stop is just to make the doodad that moves up and down with player input. 
## What button should it be?
We know we're developing on mouse and keyboard, so no matter what platform we ultimately release the game on (PC, Xbox, iOs, etc.), we have to have keyboard controls so we can test the game as we develope it on PC.
